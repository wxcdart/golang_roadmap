# Formatting and Documentation

This folder demonstrates formatting with `gofmt`/`go fmt` and how to write doc comments usable by `godoc`.

Commands:

```bash
go fmt ./...
godoc -http=:6061   # open http://localhost:6061 in browser
```

See `doc_example.go` for an example of idiomatic package-level docs and exported symbol comments.
