## Overview

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**"A class should have only one reason to change"**

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

**"Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification"**

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

**"Objects should be replaceable with their subtypes"**

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

**"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use"**

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

**"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions"**
